## Desguised Eraser

### Summary

A little application that deletes files from user personal folders. It's disguised to look like Google Chrome.
The idea is to create an apliccation that copies itself to C:/ProgramFiles/Google/Chrome/Application and then
change the chrome.exe file to chromer.exe or something like that. When "chrome.exe" is executed, the application
should delete files and then start the Chrome browser.

* This is a work in progress. Any help is welcome.
